Pre-requisite: Make sure you have created the 'Procfile'
1. make account in heroku: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps
    I used a temp mail to create an account
        email: cisil27461@mustale.com
        password: Q!***********1

2. download and install the Heroku CLI, make sure its added in PATH variables

3. You must have git on your system
    a. add, commit your code, locally

4. login to heroku from CLI using the bwlow command
    > heroku login

5. Create your app in heroku from the CLI
    > heroku create todo-sauravprakashgupta

6. Check your remote git links, you are supposed to have 'heroku' as one of the remote git repo
    > git remote -v

7. push your code to heroku
    >git push heroku master

8. check the running logs, you will get your web endpoint for the hosted application
    example: https://todo-sauravprakashgupta.herokuapp.com/
